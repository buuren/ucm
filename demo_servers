# This is an example of how you would configure the idc comannd
# Add your list of servers to the SERVERS en var  and set up
# a var for each server that points to thee root if the UCM
# installation.
# In order to use do the following:
#     source ./demo_servers
#

# List of servers to access - this can be set in your shell rather
# than in the script
export SERVERS='demo1 demo2'

# Root dir containing the remote UCM installation - again can be 
# set in the shell rather than in the script
export demo1_UCM_HOME='/u01/.....'
export demo2_UCM_HOME='/u01/.....'
